# E-CASH ATM Simulation
ATM Simulation is a Java application that simulates an automated teller machine (ATM). The application has been developed using Java and the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs).

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-life ATM, where the user can log in to their bank account using a PIN, and access their savings and current accounts. The user can view their account balance, deposit money, and withdraw money from their accounts.

# Requirements
To run this application, you need to have Java 8 or later installed on your computer.

# Usage
To use the ATM Simulation, run the ATM.java file. The application will display the GUI, where the user can enter their PIN to log in to their bank account.

After logging in, the user can select the account they want to access (savings or current), and perform the following actions:

1. View account balance
2. Deposit money
3. Withdraw money
The user can also log out of their account by clicking on the "Log Out" button.

# Features
The ATM Simulation application has the following features:

1. Login: The user can log in to their bank account using a 4-digit PIN.

2. Account Selection: The user can select the account they want to access (savings or current).

3. Account Balance: The user can view their account balance for the selected account.

4. Deposit Money: The user can deposit money into their account.

5. Withdraw Money: The user can withdraw money from their account, as long as they have sufficient funds.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts
The ATM Simulation application has been developed using the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), such as:

1.Encapsulation: The account information is encapsulated within the Account class, which can only be accessed through public methods.

2. Inheritance: The SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes inherit from the Account class, and can access its public methods.

3. Polymorphism: The Account class has a polymorphic method, getAccountType(), which is implemented differently by the SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes.
